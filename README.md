# ML Algorithms from Scratch!

Welcome to the ML Algorithms from Scratch repository, where you'll find pure Python implementations of fundamental machine learning algorithms.

## Algorithms Implemented

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression

These implementations are designed to provide a clear understanding of the inner workings of these algorithms, making it a great resource for learning and teaching.

## Installation and Usage

To get started, follow these steps to set up the required dependencies and run the algorithms.

### Dependencies

This project has a few dependencies that need to be installed. You can do this using `pip`, the Python package manager.

1. **numpy**: Used for mathematical operations and array manipulations.
2. **scikit-learn**: Utilized for data generation and testing purposes.
3. **matplotlib**: Used for creating visualizations and plots.

To install these dependencies, open a terminal or command prompt and execute the following commands based on your operating system.

#### Linux or MacOS

```sh
pip3 install numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

#### Windows

```sh
pip install numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

### Running the Algorithms

Once you have the dependencies installed, you can run the algorithms. Navigate to the specific algorithm's file using the command line and use the following command pattern to execute it:

```sh
python <algorithm_name>.py
```

Replace `<algorithm_name>` with the actual filename of the algorithm you want to run. For example, to run the Linear Regression implementation, use:

```sh
python linear_regression.py
```
